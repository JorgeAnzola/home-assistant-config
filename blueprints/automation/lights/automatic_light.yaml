  name: Automatic light
  description: >
    This automation will turn on the target light on based on a series of conditions.
    For example:
      - There's motion between a set time and day combination
      - The cinema mode is on
      - The light of the kitchen or the living room is on

    It will turn off the light when there's no more motion for X seconds.
